# Task 1: Navigate the File System

### Objective

* **Learn how to navigate the Linux file system using commands.**

**Commands to Practice:** `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`

**Task Description:**

* Start in your home directory (`~`).
* Create a new directory named `test_directory` using the `mkdir` command.
* Move into this directory using the `cd` command.
* List the contents of the directory using `ls`.
* Finally, remove the directory using `rmdir`.

**Why:** Understanding how to navigate and manipulate the file system is
fundamental for any Linux user. These commands allow you to move around the
file system, create and remove directories, and list directory contents, which
are essential skills for managing files and directories efficiently.
